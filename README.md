# DeepVision-Real-Time-Abnormal-Activity-Detection-System
## Overview

DeepVision is a real-time abnormal activity detection application leveraging YOLO (You Only Look Once) models for video analysis. The app is built with Streamlit for an intuitive user interface and provides metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and more to evaluate detection performance.


## Features

Real-time video processing: Upload a video file, and the app detects and highlights abnormal activities.
YOLO Integration: Uses advanced YOLO models for object detection and tracking.
Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit, enabling easy uploads and instant results visualization.
Performance Metrics: Includes accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and error analysis.
## Demo

## Installation
